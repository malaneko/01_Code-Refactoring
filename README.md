# UoB_Challange01
UoB_Challange01 - EdX 1st week


## Some changes I made with hope that webpage will be more accessible:

# h3 added to make Benefits titles more prominent

# colour changed to make the layout less distracting - white background and minimalism

# colours changed/discarded

# page rearrangement proposed - smaller information position swapped

# I made a mistake when cimmiting css file - I wrote 'second commit' whereas it should have been 'initial' - so no second action at all, but initial for this file
